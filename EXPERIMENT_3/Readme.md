# README - MNIST Handwritten Digit Classification

## Objective
The objective of this experiment is to build and train a deep learning model to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. The goal is to achieve high accuracy in recognizing and categorizing digits (0-9) using a neural network.

## Problem Statement
Handwritten digit recognition is a fundamental problem in the field of computer vision and machine learning. The challenge is to develop a model that can accurately classify digits despite variations in handwriting styles, sizes, and orientations. The MNIST dataset provides a standardized benchmark for evaluating such models.

## Dataset Used and Its Description
The MNIST dataset is a collection of 70,000 grayscale images of handwritten digits (0-9), each of size 28x28 pixels. The dataset is divided into:
- **Training set**: 60,000 images
- **Test set**: 10,000 images

Each image is labeled with the corresponding digit it represents. The dataset is widely used for training and testing machine learning models due to its simplicity and well-structured format.

## Deep Learning Methods Used to Solve the Problem
1. **Model Architecture**:
   - A simple feedforward neural network with the following layers:
     - `Flatten` layer to convert 28x28 images into a 1D array.
     - `Dense` layer with 128 neurons and ReLU activation.
     - `Dense` layer with 64 neurons and ReLU activation.
     - `Dense` output layer with 10 neurons (one for each digit) and softmax activation.

2. **Optimization**:
   - **Optimizer**: Adam (adaptive moment estimation).
   - **Loss Function**: Categorical cross-entropy (suitable for multi-class classification).
   - **Metrics**: Accuracy.

3. **Training**:
   - The model was trained for 10 epochs with a batch size of 32.
   - Training and validation accuracy/loss were monitored to evaluate performance.

4. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Normalized pixel values to the range [0, 1] by dividing by 255.
   - Converted labels to one-hot encoded vectors using `to_categorical`.

## Results
- The model achieved a **training accuracy of ~99.5%** and a **validation accuracy of ~97.9%** after 10 epochs.
- The training and validation loss decreased steadily, indicating effective learning without overfitting.
- Visualization of accuracy and loss over epochs showed consistent improvement.

## Conclusion
The implemented neural network demonstrated excellent performance on the MNIST dataset, achieving high accuracy in digit classification. This experiment highlights the effectiveness of deep learning for image recognition tasks, even with a relatively simple architecture. Future improvements could include experimenting with convolutional neural networks (CNNs) or data augmentation techniques to further enhance accuracy.
